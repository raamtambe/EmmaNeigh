            ## EmmaNeigh v3.0.0 - Rebuilt from scratch

            ### Downloads
            - **Windows**: Download `EmmaNeigh-Portable.exe` - just double-click to run
            - **Mac**: Download the `.dmg` file

            ### How to Use
            1. Download and run the app
            2. Drop a folder containing PDFs onto the app (or click to browse)
            3. Wait for processing
            4. Download your ZIP file with signature packets

            ### What it does
            - Scans PDFs for signature pages (looks for "BY:" and "Name:" fields)
            - Groups pages by signer name
            - Creates individual PDF packets per signer
            - Generates Excel tracking sheets

            ### Security
            - 100% local processing - no data leaves your machine
            - No internet connection required
