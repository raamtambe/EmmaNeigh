            ## EmmaNeigh v3.2.1 - MS Word Support

            ### Downloads
            - **Windows**: Download `EmmaNeigh-Portable.exe` - just double-click to run
            - **Mac**: Download the `.dmg` file

            ### What's New in v3.2.0
            - **MS Word Support: Now processes .docx files alongside PDFs
            - Works with both traditional "BY:/Name:" signature blocks AND table-based signatures
            - Recognizes column headers: "Name", "Printed Name", "Signatory", "Signer"
            - Automatically extracts signer names from schedule tables

            ### How to Use

            **Signature Packets Tab:**
            1. Drop a folder containing PDFs onto the app (or click to browse)
            2. Wait for processing - detects signatures in both blocks AND tables
            3. Download your ZIP file with signature packets organized by signer

            **Execution Version Tab:**
            1. Select folder containing original unsigned agreements
            2. Select the signed PDF from DocuSign (single PDF with all signed pages)
            3. Click "Create Execution Versions"
            4. Download ZIP with executed documents

            ### What it does
            - **Signature Packets**: Scans PDFs for signature pages (including schedule tables), groups by signer
            - **Execution Version**: Matches signed pages to originals, replaces blank signature pages in-place

            ### Security
            - 100% local processing - no data leaves your machine
            - No internet connection required
